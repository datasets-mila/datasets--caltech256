Description
***********

We introduce a challenging set of 256 object categories containing a total of
30607 images. The original Caltech-101 was collected by choosing a set of
object categories, downloading examples from Google Images and then manually
screening out all images that did not fit the category. Caltech-256 is
collected in a similar manner with several improvements: a) the number of
categories is more than doubled, b) the minimum number of images in any
category is increased from 31 to 80, c) artifacts due to image rotation are
avoided and d) a new and larger clutter category is introduced for testing
background rejection. We suggest several testing paradigms to measure
classification performance, then benchmark the dataset using two simple metrics
as well as a state-of-the-art spatial pyramid matching algorithm. Finally we
use the clutter category to train an interest detector which rejects
uninformative background regions.
